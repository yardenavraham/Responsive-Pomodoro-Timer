# :alarm_clock: Responsive Pomodoro Timer [*Under development*]

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

## :sparkles: Motivation

The idea came up due to the need to take advantage of the time. I also wanted to learn more about Bootstrap4, React, CSS.

## :sparkles: Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
